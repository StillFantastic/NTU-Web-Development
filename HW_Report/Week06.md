# Week 06


## 練習了哪些當週上課的主題
* JavaScript Objects: Utilized in structuring the code via App and UIComponent objects, illustrating complex behavior modeling and prototype-based inheritance for functionality sharing.

* DOM Manipulation: Employed for dynamic webpage interaction, utilizing methods like document.getElementById and document.querySelector for element selection and modification, showcasing dynamic styling and visibility adjustments.
JavaScript Objects: The script extensively uses objects, such as App and UIComponent, to organize code into logical sections. These objects encapsulate data and functions related to specific parts of the application, demonstrating the use of objects to model complex behaviors and structures in JavaScript.

* External Scripts: The use of SweetAlert2 via an external script inclusion.

* Prototypal Inheritance: Demonstrated through UIComponent, highlighting method inheritance from prototypes for code reuse and organizational benefits.

* Symbol for Privacy: Used within the App object to create inaccessible properties, simulating private variables for encapsulation and internal state protection.

* IIFE: Applied to encase the App object, ensuring a clean global namespace by executing the object definition immediately, illustrating a pattern to prevent global scope pollution.

* Object.create() for Inheritance: Mentioned as a method for setting up flexible and customizable prototypal inheritance, allowing direct object-to-object inheritance.
